Robert (Bob) Herman Cushman (16 January 1924 in Evanston, Illinois – 27 January 1996 in Essex, Connecticut) was an American trade magazine journalist who had written extensively across several engineering disciplines, two in particular during the vanguard of rapid technological advances and ensuing market boom of their respective technologies.  In the late 1950s, at the beginning of the Space Race, Cushman had been an editor at Aviation Week & Space Technology.  From 1962 to the late-1980s, he was an editor for Electronic Design News.  He started out at EDN as the East Coast editor and soon rose to Special Features Editor covering microprocessing.  Cushman was widely known within the microprocessing industry for his influential writings in Electronic Design News about microprocessors during its infancy in the early 1970s, through its period of rapid growth and development in the 1980s.  His articles, collectively, chronicle the birth and early milestones of microprocessors and, at the time, helped bridge technical development with applications.  Citations of his work are prevalent in documents produced by academicians, engineers, the military, and NASA. At the time of Cushman's death, he and his wife were residents of Old Lyme, Connecticut. Before retiring, he and his wife had been a long-time residents of Port Washington, New York.
