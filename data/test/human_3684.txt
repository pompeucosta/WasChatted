Micrathena gracilis is a spider in the family Araneidae (orb-weavers), commonly known as the spined micrathena or castleback orbweaver. This spider spins a moderately large (can be about 20 cm long in diameter) and very tightly coiled web. The spiders themselves are small and can be found to be anywhere from 4.2 mm to 10.8 mm long. Its venom is not medically significant to humans, making it completely harmless. M. gracilis is unique in appearance due to its large spiky abdomen and black and white bodies. Certain spiders of this species can also display a yellow color on the sides of their bodies. These spiders can be seen most active during the end of the summer and beginning of fall. M. gracilis is diurnal and are rarely ever seen active at night. Physical characteristics Females are 8–10 mm long.  They exhibit a bulbous abdomen with spines.  Males exhibit a fair amount of sexual dimorphism.  They tend to be a fraction of the size of the females.  Also, they have fewer spines, a flatter abdomen, and a slightly lighter tone.  Although males can produce silk, they mostly use it in the mating ritual.
