Tropical Cyclone Bingiza was the only named storm to make landfall in the inactive 2010–11 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. The second of three storms, Bingiza developed on February 9 to the northeast of Madagascar. For a few days it meandered generally southwestward, failing to intensify significantly. On February 12, the storm began a steady westward track as environmental conditions became more favorable. In a 24‑hour period, Bingiza developed from a moderate tropical storm into an intense tropical cyclone with a well-defined eye. After attaining peak 10–minute sustained winds of 155 km/h (100 mph), the cyclone moved ashore in northeastern Madagascar on February 14 and quickly weakened as it crossed the country. Bingiza emerged into the Mozambique Channel as a weak tropical disturbance, and it turned southward to move across western Madagascar. Bingiza attained tropical storm status before making its final landfall near Morondava, degenerating into a remnant low on February 17, and dissipating two days later. Across Madagascar, the cyclone killed 34 people and injured 13 others. High winds destroyed 25,464 houses, which left 25,845 people homeless. Bingiza first affected the Masoala National Park, destroying half of a village and leaving it isolated. High winds and heavy rainfall left over 500 km2km (195 mi2) of damaged crops, which increased food prices and threatened the economic livelihoods of the affected people.
