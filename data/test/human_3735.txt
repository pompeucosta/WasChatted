Meadowbrook Country Club is a country club in Northville Township, Wayne County, near Northville, Michigan. The idea for Meadowbrook Country Club, a private golf and social club, came about in 1916 when 23 Northville businessmen purchased  of the Fred C. Cochran Farm. The club was named after a brook, which ran through the property. Its golf course hosted the PGA Championship in 1955, won by Doug Ford.  Willie Park, Jr is credited with designing the original Meadowbrook 6-hole course which are present-day holes #10, #11, #7, #2, #3, and #18. Meadowbrook has hosted The Motor City Open which was a PGA Tour event played at various clubs in and around Detroit from the late 1940s to the early 1960s.   The PGA Tour record for the longest sudden-death playoff was established at the 1949 Motor City Open, played at Meadowbrook.   Cary Middlecoff and Lloyd Mangrum played 11 holes at Meadowbrook Country Club and were still stalemated when darkness arrived. Tournament officials, with the players mutual consent, declared them co-winners.
