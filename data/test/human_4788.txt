Vorobyov, who was born in the Kursk region, Soviet Russia but spent most of his life in Vilnius, Lithuania (then in the USSR; also his deathplace), wrote 10 short novels (best known is Slain Near Moscow, 1963) and 30 short stories, many of which were either unpublished in his lifetime or suffered greatly from massive censorial cuts. According to the poet, critic and literature historian Dmitry Bykov, Vorobyov was "the most American of all Russian writers, a strange mix of Hemingway and Capote".
