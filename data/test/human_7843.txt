Anemone occidentalis, the white pasqueflower or western pasqueflower, is a herbaceous species of flowering plant in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae. Other authorities place it in the genus Pulsatilla.  Individuals are  tall, from caudices, with three to six leaves at the base of the plant that are 3-foliolate, each leaflet pinnatifid to dissected in shape. Leaf petioles are  long.  Leaves have villous hairs and their margins are pinnatifid or dissected. Plants flower briefly mid-spring to mid-summer, usually soon after the ground is exposed by melting snow. The flowers are composed of five to seven sepals (sometimes called tepals), normally white or soft purple, also mixed white and blueish purple, one flower per stem. The sepals are  long and  wide. Flowers have 150–200 stamens. The fruit occurs in heads rounded to subcylindric in shape, with pedicels  long. The achenes are ellipsoid in shape, not winged, covered with villous hairs, with beaks curved that reflex as they age and  long, feather-like.  Generally, the fruit persists into fall. Native to far western North America including British Columbia to California and Montana, it is found growing in gravelly soils on slopes and in moist meadows.
