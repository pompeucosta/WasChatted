Stenoma condemnatrix is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1930. It is found in Colombia. The wingspan is about 34 mm. The forewings are whitish ochreous strewn with slight irregular infuscation. There is a slight streak beneath the costal edge except towards the extremities and the base of the costal edge is dark fuscous. The discal stigmata are very small and black, the plical forming a rather large round blackish spot obliquely beyond the first discal, a spot of fuscous suffusion on the dorsum beneath this. There is an irregular interrupted excurved shade of indistinct fuscous suffusion from beneath the middle of the costa to the dorsum at four-fifths, indented on the fold. An excurved series of fuscous dots is found from beneath the costa at three-fifths to the tornus, slightly sinuate above the middle. Two or three slight fuscous marks are found on the costa towards the apex and there is a terminal series of dark fuscous dots. The hindwings are ochreous whitish.
