Monsters vs. Aliens is a 2009 American computer-animated film produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film was directed by Conrad Vernon and Rob Letterman and features the voices of Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett, Kiefer Sutherland, Rainn Wilson, Paul Rudd, and Stephen Colbert. The film involves a group of misfit monsters (Susan, also known as Ginormica, a woman who was hit by a giant meteorite on her wedding day and grew to be 50 feet tall, B.O.B., an indestructible gelatinous mass-created when a dessert topping was combined with a tomato, Dr. Cockroach, a scientist who became a bug man after his experiment went wrong, the Missing Link, a 20,000-year-old macho fish man who was thawed out by Arctic explorers, and Insectosaurus, a 350-foot tall grub after being mutated by nuclear radiation) hired by the United States Armed Forces to stop an alien invasion and save the day in exchange for freedom. It was DreamWorks Animation's first feature film to be directly produced in a stereoscopic 3-D format instead of being converted into 3-D after completion, which added $15 million to the film's budget.
