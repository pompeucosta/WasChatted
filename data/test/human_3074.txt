The company was founded in 2014 by Roc Nation CEO, Laurence Brown Jr., but indirectly owned and controlled by rapper and businessman Shawn Carter, also known as Jay Z, to purchase the assets of Norwegian technology company Aspiro. By purchasing Aspiro, the company became the sole owner of the music streaming services TIDAL and WiMP. WiMP merged into Tidal in March 2015. In March 2021, majority ownership in Tidal was acquired by Square, Inc. History On 30 January 2015, it was announced that Project Panther Bidco Ltd. had bid SEK 464 million (£36 million, US$56 million) for the Norwegian technology Aspiro, developers of audio streaming services TIDAL and WiMP.
