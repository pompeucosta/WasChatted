The 1945 Hazara Rebellion was a rebellion by the Hazaras in the Kingdom of Afghanistan which occurred in 1945 and 1946. Its causes laid in the introduction of a new tax imposed only on the Hazaras. It began in November 1945, when Hazara Rebels under Ibrahim Khan, also known as "Bačča-Gāw-sawār" (Son of the cow rider) revolted against the local administration of Shahristan. After a siege lasting for about a week, the district, as well as arms and ammunition, fell into the hands of the rebels. There are two different accounts as to how the rebellion ended: According to Encyclopædia Iranica, the Afghan government sent a force to pacify the region and subsequently withdrew the tax. According to Niamatullah Ibrahimi, it ended In spring 1946, when Mohammed Zahir Shah sent a delegation to the rebels, offering to lift the tax if the rebels laid down their arms, which was accepted.
