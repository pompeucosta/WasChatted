East Itchenor is the site of a demolished 'manor' house, on the Manhood Peninsula,  in West Sussex, England. There was never an actual manor (in the legal sense) nor is it an abandoned village. This is an area of dispersed settlements rather than nucleated ones. History  East Itchenor derives its name from the Anglo-Saxon chieftain Icca, who laid claim to the shores of East and West Itchenor, as both settlements were originally known as Iccannore ('Icca's shore'). Although the Domesday Book of 1086 names the village as Icenore, by 1268 it was recorded as Estychenore and its eponymous sister village as Westichenor. The Domesday Book also makes mention of two manors in Icenore, necessitating the distinction between 'East' and 'West': the manor covering East Itchenor was owned by the Bishop of Exeter Osbern FitzOsbern and was an endowment of the College of Bosham. East Itchenor was then held by Roger de Montgomery who attached it to his manor of Birdham. There was never a separate manor of East Itchenor with demesne holdings or manor courts.
