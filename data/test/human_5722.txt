Dundori is a settlement in Kenya's Rift valley Province. History The province is inhabited by the Kikuyu speaking who are part of the Kenya Eastern Bantu.  During Kenya's colonization by the British, much of the province was regarded as part of the 'White Highlands', for the exclusive use of the settler community.
